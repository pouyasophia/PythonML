    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case - for example if we had 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the other 98 weren't - accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam (including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam (all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the **F1 score**, which is the weighted average of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score."
